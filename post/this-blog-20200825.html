<h1>This blog</h1>
<div>Mon Aug 24 00:00:00 BST 2020</div>
<div><p>I just created this blog using a custom static site generator that I created using <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/andybrewer/mvp">MVP CSS</a>.</p>
<p>So, how does this blog work?  It reads in markdown files containg the content from a git repository and from that, generates the HTML that you can see as a static site.  So far this is really basic; it just takes this markdown but can't handle images or other embeded elements.  That is something I want to try and include at a later date.</p>
